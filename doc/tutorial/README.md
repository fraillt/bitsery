The grand plan for this tutorial is to learn how to serialize/deserialize any object efficiently in time and space, so you could focus on other, more interesting things.

This tutorial will cover these main topics:
* [Getting started](hello_world.md) with bitsery, and serialize/deserialize your first object.
* [Extend to your needs](first_extension.md) by enabling serialization/deserialization depending on version number.
* `Squeeze Me!` compress your data when you know what it stores.
* `Anything is Possible` extend library for custom container, compress geometry and more.
* `Little or Big` change endianness if you want best performance on PowerPC.
